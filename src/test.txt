Use git checkout ui-fixes to switch to the branch and then git cherry-pick <commit-hash> to move the commit from main to ui-fixes.

Run git fetch origin followed by git reset --hard origin/main to align with the remote.

Resolve the conflict in bookingController.java, then git add . and git merge --continue.

Recreate the branch using git checkout -b booking-module <commit-hash> from where it was deleted.

Use git rebase -i HEAD~3, squash the commits, and save the changes.

Use git revert <commit-hash> to bring back the removal commit.

Stash the current changes with git stash and apply the hotfix.

Use git rebase -i --root to clean up unnecessary merge commits.

Run git format-patch -2 to generate patches and git apply <patch-file> to apply them.

Use git reflog to find the lost commit, then git checkout <commit-hash> and git push --force
